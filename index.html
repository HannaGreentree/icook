      <p>
        <strong>Do you enjoy cooking, do you have time for it, or maybe you do not know how to make a 
        delicious dinner for yourself and your family?</strong> - that’s perfectly okay, that is why we 
        are here to make life easier. Hire your local Private Chef today — <strong>it’s more 
        affordable than you think</strong>, even if it may sound like a luxury.

    <div class="invite-column">
      <p>We’re happy to cook using your favorite recipes, or we can suggest some of ours. 
        Our chef works in the popular 5* restaurant and holds a food hygiene certificate accordingly. 
        Our philosophy is simple: we shouldn’t just eat food — we should enjoy the food we truly 
        love. Eat what you love with <strong>iCOOK</strong> because you can.

  <!--HOW IT WORKS TEXT-->
  <div class="text-container">
    <h3 class="desktop-text">How it works</h3>
    <p class="desktop-text">
      Not everyone has the time or ability to cook, yet homemade food is often the healthiest and most 
      satisfying option. If you can afford to dine out at restaurants, you can certainly afford the comfort 
      and quality of freshly prepared meals from our private chef. Restaurants may not always meet your 
      expectations — the dish you love might not be available, menus change, or certain ingredients 
      can’t be customized. With a private chef, those risks disappear. You 
      decide what you want to eat, whether it’s your favorite family recipe or something new you’ve 
      discovered online, and our chef will bring it to life in your own kitchen.
    </p>
    <p class="desktop-text">
      Depending on the recipe, preparation time may vary. To keep costs low, you can purchase the ingredients 
      yourself, or for convenience, our chef can shop for you at a small additional cost — typically 
      £5 plus the price of the groceries, with all receipts provided. When your chef arrives, you’ll only be 
      charged for the time spent cooking in your kitchen. All pricing and details are agreed upon in advance, 
      so there are no surprises. All you need to do is make sure your kitchen is ready, and your private chef 
      will take care of the rest.

      Pretty much anything you like! Our chef can prepare her signature dishes, or you can share your 
      preferences and favorite recipes. If there are ingredients you don’t enjoy, or if you have specific 
      dietary needs, simply let her know — she’ll be happy to suggest alternatives that suit your taste.
      To avoid any confusion, it’s always a good idea to put your requests in writing. This way, you’ll
